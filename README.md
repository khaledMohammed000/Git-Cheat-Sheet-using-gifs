# Git-Cheat-Sheet-using-gifs

Cheat sheet for **Git commands** for _super busy_ people using **gifs**  

**Intention** is to get people just **_spend 6-7 seconds_** to figure out what the **git command does** 
and **how to use it** with a GIF demo
and save them the trouble to ~~watch some video~~ or ~~read some blog~~

###We will go through all the commands in the order we do it for our documents
